If an existing basis set in PySCF is being used, the cart attribute is automatically set based on how the basis set itself was optimized. Thus, it is not necessary to define this attribute for most calculations.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  If either a custom basis set is being used or one that is not pre-defined in PySCF, it is important to determine the appropriate value of cart and set it accordingly. For example, the [UGBS basis set](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.475959) is commonly used to determine absolute atomic energies. This basis set was optimized for use with spherical functions. Since UGBS is not pre-defined in PySCF, it is important to set `mol.cart=0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If the user is interested in experimenting with the effect of using spherical vs. Cartesian functions for a given basis set, it is possible to override the default for pre-defined basis sets. For example, the Dunning basis sets (cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pVXZ) are meant to be used with spherical functions (`mol.cart=0`), yet one can set `mol.cart=1` to gauge the sensitivity of absolute and relative energies to this setting.\n",

For this reason, a great deal of work has been devoted to developing effective core potentials (ECP) which replace core electrons around a nucleus by pseudopotentials.\n",

    "## xc attribute\n",
    "#### (NO DEFAULT)\n",
    "\n",
    "The xc attribute sets the density functional approximation. A vast number of exchange-correlation functionals are available for use in PySCF, essentially all of those that are available in the installed version of libxc. For example, the functionals available in libxc 4.0.4 are listed [here](https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc/wikis/Functionals-list-4.0.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the parsing rules for the xc attribute are explained in the [PySCF manual](http://sunqm.github.io/pyscf/dft.html#customizing-xc-functional), we will go through a main relevant examples here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standard (pre-coded) exchange-correlation functional\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A classic example of this scenario is the beloved B3LYP functional. To run a B3LYP calculation, simply specify `mf.xc='B3LYP'`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * As long as commas and operators are not used, PySCF will assume that the string indicates a full exchange-correlation functional. Other examples may include `mf.xc='PBE'`, `mf.xc='TPSS'`, `mf.xc='M06-L'`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Combination of a single exchange functional with a single correlation functional\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This is a popular choice, particularly for using various combinations of the older exchange and correlation functionals from the 1980s and 1990s.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * In PySCF, inserting a comma into the xc attribute string indicates a separation into exchange (left of the comma) and correlation (right of the comma). For instance, if once wants to run B88 exchange with PBE correlation, it is as simple as `mf.xc='B88,PBE'`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Since the PBE exchange-correlation functional is a combination of PBE exchange and PBE correlation, it follows that `mf.xc='PBE'` and `mf.xc='PBE,PBE'` are exactly equivalant ways of using the PBE xc functional.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Other popular combinations of a single exchange functional with a single correlation functional include `mf.xc='B88,LYP'`, `mf.xc='revPBE,PBE'`, and `mf.xc='OPTX,LYP'`. These combinations are historically known as BLYP, revPBE, and OLYP, and can equivalently be called as `mf.xc='BLYP'`, `mf.xc='revPBE'`, and `mf.xc='OLYP'`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * This option is most useful when one is interested in an unconventional combination, for example, the combination of PBE exchange with TPSS correlation, `mf.xc='PBE,TPSS'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Single exchange functional or single correlation functional\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Using a single exchange functional, for example, PBE exchange only, is as simple as `mf.xc='PBE,'`. Similarly, PBE correlation only can be specified with `mf.xc=',PBE'`. In the first case (PBE exchange only), the fact that there is a comma indicates to the parser that that a pre-coded xc functional is not being utilized. Therefore, anything to the left of the comma (PBE) is taken to be the exchange functional, while anything to the right of the comma (nothing) is taken to be the correlation functional. The reverse situation applies to the second case with PBE correlation only.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Custom exchange-correlation functional\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Naturally, it is possible to fully customize the xc attribute. Once again, anything to the left of the comma is assumed to be referring to exchange, and anything to the right of the comma is assumed to be reffering to correlation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * In order to start with something simple, we will demonstrate how to specify the popular [PBE0](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.478522) xc functional by building it from its components (the easy way to do this is simply `mf.xc='PBE0'`). PBE0 is comprised of 25% exact (Hartree–Fock) exchange, 75% PBE exchange, and 100% PBE correlation. This can be accomplished by the following line: `mf.xc='0.25*HF+0.75*PBE,PBE'`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * A more complicated example is that of B3LYP. B3LYP is comprised of 20% exact (Hartree–Fock) exchange, 8% LDA exchange, 72% B88 exchange, 19% VWN correlation, and 81% LYP correlation. Unfortunately, there are 6 existing parameterization of the VWN LDA correlation functional, and this has led to much confusion through the years.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * PySCF, TURBOMOLE, GAMESS, ORCA, and PSI4 all use the VWN5 parameterization, and the following two assignments are equivalent:\n",
    "    * `mf.xc='B3LYP'`\n",
    "    * `mf.xc='0.2*HF+0.08*LDA+0.72*B88,0.19*VWN5+0.81*LYP'`\n",
    "  * Q-Chem and NWChem use the VWN1RPA parameterization:\n",
    "    * `mf.xc='0.2*HF+0.08*LDA+0.72*B88,0.19*VWN_RPA+0.81*LYP'`\n",
    "  * Gaussian uses the VWN3 parameterization:\n",
    "    * `mf.xc='0.2*HF+0.08*LDA+0.72*B88,0.19*VWN3+0.81*LYP'`\n",
