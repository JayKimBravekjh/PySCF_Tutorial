    "Advanced users who are interested in using custom basis sets or basis sets that not pre-defined in PySCF are directed [here](http://sunqm.github.io/pyscf/gto.html#input-basis). Useful resources for the latter include the [EMSL basis set exchange](https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal), the [PSI4 basis set page](http://www.psicode.org/psi4manual/master/basissets_byfamily.html), Grant Hill's [ccRepo](http://www.grant-hill.group.shef.ac.uk/ccrepo/), and the [TURBOMOLE basis set library](http://www.cosmologic-services.de/basis-sets/basissets.php). PySCF can parse NWChem- and Gaussian94-formatted basis sets [TODO].\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the STO-2G basis set is not pre-defined in PySCF. If one wants to use the STO-2G basis set for the hydrogen atoms and the STO-3G basis set for the oxygen atoms, then the appropriate basis setup would be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mol.basis={'H': gto.basis.parse('''\n",

    "'''),'O': 'STO-3G'}\n",
    "```\n",

    "Additionally, PySCF can read a file containing the desired basis set [TODO]:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mol.basis={'H': gto.basis.read('basis/STO-2G.dat'),'O': 'STO-3G'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## cart attribute\n",
    "#### DEFAULT: ```mol.cart=0```\n",
    "\n",
    "The cart attribute determines whether the d and/or higher basis functions are taken to be *spherical* (i.e., d=5 functions, f=7 functions, g=9 functions, etc.) or *Cartesian* (i.e., d=6 functions, f=10 functions, g=15 functions, etc.). ```mol.cart=0``` specifices *spherical* functions and ```mol.cart=1``` specifies *Cartesian* functions. If an existing basis set in PySCF is being used, the cart attribute is automatically set based on how the basis set itself was optimized. Thus, it is not necessary to define this attribute for most calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two instances where specifying the cart attribute is necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If either a custom basis set is being used or one that is not pre-defined in PySCF, it is important to determine the appropriate value of cart and set it accordingly. For example, the [UGBS basis set](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.475959) is commonly used to determine absolute atomic energies. This basis set was optimized for use with spherical functions. Since UGBS is not pre-defined in PySCF, it is important to set ```mol.cart=0```.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If the user is interested in experimenting with the effect of using spherical vs. Cartesian functions for a given basis set, it is possible to override the default for pre-defined basis sets. For example, the Dunning basis sets (cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pVXZ) are meant to be used with spherical functions (```mol.cart=0```), yet one can set ```mol.cart=1``` to gauge the sensitivity of absolute and relative energies to this setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## charge attribute\n",
    "#### DEFAULT: ```mol.charge=0```\n",
    "\n",
    "The charge attribute sets the charge of the molecule, and is 0 for neutral systems, 1 for cations, 2 for dications, -1 for anions, -2 for dianions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ecp attribute\n",
    "#### DEFAULT: ```mol.ecp={}```\n",
    "\n",
    "When heavy elements are present in a molecule, standard Gaussian basis sets are oftentimes both insufficient (because they are unable to capture the relativistic nature of heavier elements) and impractical (because as one descends the rows of the periodic table, Gaussian basis sets tend to become very large and heavily-contracted due to the increased number of electrons). For this reason, a great deal of work has been devoted to developing effective core potentials (ECP) which replace core electrons around a nucleus by pseudopotentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "In PySCF, the ecp attribute is very similar to the basis attribute. To demonstrate the use of the ecp attribute, we will switch to a system with heavy elements, namely, TeH<sub>2</sub>--HI. This system is from the [HEAVY28](http://www.thch.uni-bonn.de/tc.old/downloads/GMTKN/GMTKN55/HEAVY28.html) dataset of the [GMTKN55](https://www.chemie.uni-bonn.de/pctc/mulliken-center/software/GMTKN/gmtkn55) database.

    "## xc attribute\n",
    "#### (NO DEFAULT)\n",
    "\n",
    "The xc attribute sets the density functional approximation. A vast number of exchange-correlation functionals are available for use in PySCF, essentially all of those that are available in the installed version of libxc. For example, the functionals available in libxc 4.0.4 are listed [here](https://gitlab.com/libxc/libxc/wikis/Functionals-list-4.0.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the parsing rules for the xc attribute are explained in the [PySCF manual](http://sunqm.github.io/pyscf/dft.html#customizing-xc-functional), we will go through a few relevant examples here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Standard (pre-coded) exchange-correlation functional\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A classic example of this scenario is the beloved B3LYP functional. To run a B3LYP calculation, simply specify ```mf.xc='B3LYP'```.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * As long as commas and operators are not used, PySCF will assume that the string indicates a full exchange-correlation functional. Other examples may include ```mf.xc='PBE'```, ```mf.xc='TPSS'```, ```mf.xc='M06-L'```, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Combination of a single exchange functional with a single correlation functional\n",
    "\n",
    "  * This is a popular choice, particularly for using various combinations of the older exchange and correlation functionals from the 1980s and 1990s.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * In PySCF, inserting a comma into the xc attribute string indicates a separation into exchange (left of the comma) and correlation (right of the comma). For instance, if once wants to run B88 exchange with PBE correlation, it is as simple as ```mf.xc='B88,PBE'```.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Since the PBE exchange-correlation functional is a combination of PBE exchange and PBE correlation, it follows that ```mf.xc='PBE'``` and ```mf.xc='PBE,PBE'``` are exactly equivalant ways to use the PBE xc functional.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Other popular combinations of a single exchange functional with a single correlation functional include ```mf.xc='B88,LYP'```, ```mf.xc='revPBE,PBE'```, ```mf.xc='OPTX,LYP'```, etc. These combinations are historically known as BLYP, revPBE, and OLYP, and can equivalently be called as ```mf.xc='BLYP'```, ```mf.xc='revPBE'```, ```mf.xc='OLYP'```.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * This option is most useful when one is interested in a unconventional combination, for example, the combination of PBE exchange with TPSS correlation, ```mf.xc='PBE,TPSS'```.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Single exchange functional or single correlation functional\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Using a single exchange functional, for example, PBE exchange only, is as simple as ```mf.xc='PBE,'```. Similarly, PBE correlation only can be specified with ```mf.xc=',PBE'```. In the first case (PBE exchange only), the fact that there is a comma indicates to the parser that that a pre-coded xc functional is not being utilized. Therefore, anything to the left of the comma (PBE) is taken to be the exchange functional, while anything to the right of the comma (nothing) is taken to be the correlation functional. The reverse situation applies to the second case with PBE correlation only.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Custom exchange-correlation functional\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Naturally, it is possible to fully customize the xc attribute. Once again, anything to the left of the comma is assumed to be referring to exchange, and anything to the right of the comma is assumed to be reffering to correlation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * In order to start with something simple, we will demonstrate how to specify the popular [PBE0](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.478522) xc functional by building it from its components (the easy way to do this is simply ```mf.xc='PBE0'```). PBE0 is comprised of 25\\% exact (Hartree--Fock) exchange, 75\\% PBE exchange, and 100\\% PBE correlation. This can be accomplished by the following line: ```mf.xc='0.25*HF+0.75*PBE,PBE'```.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * A more complicated example is that of B3LYP. B3LYP is comprised of 20\\% exact (Hartree--Fock) exchange, 8\\% LDA exchange, 72\\% B88 exchange, 19\\% VWN correlation, and 81\\% LYP correlation. Unfortunately, there are 6 existing parameterization of the VWN LDA correlation functional, and this has led to much confusion through the years.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * PySCF uses the VWN5 parameterization, meaning the the following two assignments are equivalent\n",
    "    * mf.xc='B3LYP'\n",
    "    * mf.xc='0.2\\*HF+0.08\\*LDA+0.72\\*B88,0.19\\*VWN5+0.81\\*LYP'\n",
    "  * Q-Chem uses the VWN1RPA parameterization:\n",
    "    * mf.xc='0.2\\*HF+0.08\\*LDA+0.72\\*B88,0.19\\*VWN1RPA+0.81\\*LYP'\n",
    "  * Gaussian uses the VWN3 parameterization:\n",
