    "Another useful way to set up a molecule is to read the coordinates from an existing file. The file can either be an XYZ (see geom/water_dimer.xyz), contain only the coordinates (see geom/water_dimer.mol), or contain the coordinates prepended by a line containing the charge and spin separated by a space (see geom/water_dimer.qc). As long as the file is in one of the three aforementioned formats, PySCF can automatically detect and parse the file. Reading in a molecule file can be accomplished via:\n",

    "```\n",
    "In this case, the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set is used for all of the hydrogen and oxygen atoms.\n",

    "```\n",
    "In this case, the cc-pVDZ basis set is used for all of the hydrogen atoms, while the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set is used for all of the oxygen atoms.\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, one common way of reducing basis set superposition error (BSSE) is to use counterpoise corrections by employing ghost functions on ghost atoms. A useful guide to BSSE can be found [here](http://vergil.chemistry.gatech.edu/notes/cp.pdf). In PySCF, counterpoise corrections can be applied via simple modifications to the atom and basis attributes.\n",

    "Advanced users who are interested in using custom basis sets or basis sets that not pre-defined in PySCF are directed [here](http://sunqm.github.io/pyscf/gto.html#input-basis). Useful resources for the latter include the [EMSL basis set exchange](https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal) and the [PSI4 basis set page](http://www.psicode.org/psi4manual/master/basissets_byfamily.html). PySCF can parse both NWChem and Gaussian94 format basis set files. Additionally, PySCF can read a file containing the desired basis set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## cart attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "The cart attribute determines whether the d and/or higher basis functions are taken to be *spherical* (i.e., d=5 functions, f=7 functions, g=9 functions, etc.) or *Cartesian* (i.e., d=6 functions, f=10 functions, g=15 functions, etc.). mol.cart=0 (default) specifices *spherical* functions and mol.cart=1 specifies *Cartesian* functions. If an existing basis set in PySCF is being used, the cart attribute is automatically set based on how the basis set itself was optimized. Thus, it is not necessary to define this attribute for most calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two instances where specifying mol.cart is necessary, and this will pertain primarily to more advanced users:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If either a custom basis set is being used or one that is not pre-defined in PySCF, it is important to determine the appropriate value of mol.cart and set it accordingly. For example, the [UGBS basis set](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.475959) is commonly used to determine absolute atomic energies. This basis set was optimized for use with spherical basis functions. Since UGBS is not pre-defined in PySCF, it is important to set mol.cart=0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  If the user is interested in experimenting with the effect of using spherical vs. Cartesian functions for a given basis set, it is possible to override the default for pre-defined basis sets. For example, the Dunning basis sets (cc-pVXZ and aug-cc-pVXZ) are meant to be used with spherical functions (mol.cart=0), yet one can set mol.cart=1 to gauge the sensitivity of absolute and relative energies to this setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## charge attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "The charge attribute sets the charge of the molecule, and is 0 for neutral systems (default), 1 for cations, 2 for dications, -1 for anions, -2 for dianions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ecp attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "When heavy elements are present in a molecule, standard Gaussian basis sets are oftentimes both insufficient (because they are unable to capture relativistic effects that are in heavier elements) and impractical (because as one descends the rows of the periodic table, Gaussian basis sets tend to become very large and heavily-contracted due to the increased number of electrons). For this reason, a great deal of work has been devoted to developing effective core potentials (ECP) which replace core electrons around a nucleus by pseudopotentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## spin attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "The spin attribute simply sets the number of unpaired electrons. By default, a closed-shell system is assumed and the value of mol.spin=0. For open-shell systems, the spin must be set. For example, boron has a single unpaired electron, so mol.spin=1. Carbon has two unpaired electrons, so mol.spin=2. And finally, nitrogen has three unpaired electrons, so mol.spin=3. The same concept applies to open-shell molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## unit attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit attribute can be either set to 'Angstrom' (default) or 'Bohr'. This entirely depends on the coordinates specified in mol.atom.\n",
    "\n",
    "## verbose attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "The verbose attribute controls the print level for the Mole object. Setting mol.verbose=0 will print little to no information, while setting mol.verbose=4 prints useful information about the basis and number of basis functions. Users who want to see detailed information should set mol.verbose=10.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is to build the molecule object:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mol.build()\n",
    "```"

    "After the molecule has been built, it is necessary to follow a similar procedure to initialize the SCF object [Hartree--Fock (HF) or Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT)]. For most users, the relevant SCF classes will be RHF (Restricted Hartree--Fock), UHF (Unrestricted Hartree--Fock), RKS (Restricted Kohn--Sham), and UKS (Unrestricted Kohn--Sham). RHF and RKS can also be used to run ROHF (Restricted Open-Shell Hartree--Fock) and ROKS (Restricted Open-Shell Kohn--Sham) as long as an open-shell molecule is defined.\n",

    "In this example, the object is name mf (mean-field). The input object is the molecule (mol) that was discussed previously.\n",

    "## conv_tol attribute\n",
    "In order for an SCF calculation to converge, PySCF requires two criteria to be met. The first is controlled by the conv_tol attribute, namely the difference in the SCF energy between two sucessive cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "## conv_tol_grad attribute\n",
    "The second criterion for convergence is the conv_tol_grad attribute, namely, the root-mean-square of the orbital gradient. This is a vector of length nocc\\*nvirt.\n",

    "A good initial guess is vital for an efficient SCF procedure. There are four initial guess options in PySCF:\n",

    "3. 1e\n",
    "4. chkfile\n",
    "\n",
    "The first option (```mf.init_guess='minao'```) is the default option and generates an initial guess for the density matrix based on the ANO basis, and then projects this onto the basis set specified in ```mol.basis```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option (```mf.init_guess='atom'```) generates and initial guess based on a superposition of atomic densities.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The last option (```mf.init_guess='chkfile'```) is somewhat advanced and can read in an existing density matrix from disk. Further information on this option can be found [here](http://sunqm.github.io/pyscf/scf.html#pyscf.scf.hf.SCF.init_guess_by_chkfile).\n",
    "\n",
    "## max_cycle attribute\n",
    "The max_cycle attribute simply sets the maximum number of SCF cycles that should be carried out before the calculation terminates. The default value is 50, but for systems that are notoriously difficult to converge, the value should be increased to 100 or even 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## max_memory attribute\n",
    "The max_memory attribute determines the maximum amount of memory that PySCF is allowed to utilize during the SCF procedure. This should be set by the user based on the memory limitations of the computer/server utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## verbose attribute\n",
    "The verbose attribute controls the print level for the RHF object. Setting mol.verbose=0 will print only the SCF energy, while setting mol.verbose=4 prints useful information about SCF settings as well as the SCF energy per iteration, HOMO/LUMO energies, and convergence metris. Users who want to see detailed information should set mol.verbose=10, which provides additional information such as molecular orbital energies.\n",
